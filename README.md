# SocketProgramming

**TCP:** Create an Echo-Server using TCP socket programming in connection- oriented Scenario. Echo Server echo back (return back) the message sent by the client. Also, write the Client side program.

**UDP:** Create an Echo-Server using UDP socket programming in connection-less. Echo Server echo back (return back) the message sent by the client. Also, write the Client side program.

**TCP chat-bot:** Create a Chat application using TCP socket programming in connection- oriented Scenario. In Chat application server and client application can chat with each other through text messages. The chat ends when server or client application sends “exit” message.

**UDP chat-bot:** Implement Chat application between server and client using UDP socket programming in a connection-less scenario. In Chat application server and client application can chat with each other through text messages. The chat ends when server or client application sends “exit” message.
